- en: This book is for advanced users such as system administrators and developers
    who want to extend Nginx's functionality using its highly flexible add-on system.
    We look at the existing modules available and how to compile and install them,
    along with practical examples of how to configure them with focus on optimizing
    the configuration. It also goes beyond what is available off the shelf and teaches
    you how to write your own module, in case something is not available from the
    big Nginx open source community.

- en: This book will help you understand the module-based architecture of Nginx. You
    will learn to install Nginx as well as extend it with several available modules.
    This book specially touches on the topic of creating your own Nginx modules. Most
    people have to read heaps of code to get this done. This book will make it easier
    for advanced users who are looking to extend Nginx by not only using existing
    modules, but also writing something of their own.
