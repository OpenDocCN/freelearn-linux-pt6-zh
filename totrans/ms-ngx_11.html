Igor Sysoev, the original author of NGINX, co-founded NGINX, Inc. in 2011 to offer professional support to companies using NGINX. He and the other NGINX developers are still available to the community, though. This appendix provides a brief overview of community resources available online.</p><p>Topics covered in this appendix include the following:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Mailing list</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">IRC channel</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Web resources</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Writing a proper bug report</li></ul></div><div class="section" title="Mailing list"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec70"/>Mailing list</h1></div></div></div><p>The mailing list<a id="id1612" class="indexterm"/> at <code class="literal">nginx@nginx.org</code> has been active since 2005. Subscribing to the list and seeing what kind of questions are asked and how they are answered is the best way to get an idea of how to get help from the list. Before asking a question, search online for an answer first. There is also an FAQ<a id="id1613" class="indexterm"/> at <a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/Faq">http://wiki.nginx.org/Faq</a>. See if someone has already asked the question recently by searching the archives at <a class="ulink" href="http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx/">http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx/</a>. It's not only embarrassing for you if the same question has been asked recently, but it's also annoying to the readers of the list.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="IRC channel"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec71"/>IRC channel</h1></div></div></div><p>The IRC channel<a id="id1614" class="indexterm"/> <code class="literal">#nginx</code> at <code class="literal">irc.freenode.net</code> is a real-time resource for those interested in getting to know the developers and having helpful responses to short queries. Please do follow IRC etiquette though when visiting the channel. Larger blocks of <a id="id1615" class="indexterm"/>text such as configuration files or compilation output should go into a Pastebin and only the URL copied into the channel. More details about the channel can be found at <a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.nginx.org/IRC">http://wiki.nginx.org/IRC</a>.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Web resources"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec72"/>Web resources</h1></div></div></div><p>The <a id="id1616" class="indexterm"/>wiki at <a class="ulink" href="http://wiki.nginx.org">http://wiki.nginx.org</a> has been a useful resource for a number of years. Here you will find a complete directive reference, a module listing, and a number of configuration examples. Keep in mind though, that this is a wiki, and the information found on it is not guaranteed to be accurate, up-to-date, or to fit your needs exactly. As we have seen throughout this book, it is always important to think about what you want to accomplish before setting out to derive the solution.</p><p>NGINX, Inc. maintains the official reference documentation<a id="id1617" class="indexterm"/> located at <a class="ulink" href="http://nginx.org/en/docs/">http://nginx.org/en/docs/</a>. There are some documents introducing NGINX, as well as How-to's and pages describing each module and directive.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Writing a good bug report"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec73"/>Writing a good bug report</h1></div></div></div><p>When searching for<a id="id1618" class="indexterm"/> help online, it is useful to be able to write a good bug report. You will find that an answer is much more easily forthcoming if you can formulate the problem in a clear, reproducible way. This section will help you do just that.</p><p>The most difficult part of a bug report is actually defining the problem itself. It will help you to first think about what it is you are trying to accomplish. State your goal in a clear, concise manner as follows:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">I need all requests to subdomain.example.com to be served from server1.</pre></div><p>Avoid writing reports in the following manner:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">I'm getting requests served from the local filesystem instead of proxying them to server1 when I call subdomain.example.com.</pre></div><p>Do you see the difference between these two statements? In the first case, you can clearly see that there is a specific goal in mind. The second case describes more the result of the problem than the goal itself.</p><p>Once the problem has been defined, the next step is describing how that problem can be reproduced:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">Calling http://subdomain.example.com/serverstatus yields a "404 File Not Found".</pre></div><p>This will help whoever is looking at this problem to try to solve it. It ensures that there is a non-working case that can be shown to be working once the problem is solved.</p><p>Next, it is helpful to describe the environment in which this problem was observed. Some bugs only surface in certain operating systems or with a particular version of a dependent library.</p><p>Any <a id="id1619" class="indexterm"/>configuration files necessary to reproduce the problem should be included in the report. If a file is found in the software archive, then a reference to that file is enough.</p><p>Read your bug report before sending it off. Often, you will find that some information has been left out. Sometimes, you will find that you have even solved the problem yourself, just by defining it clearly!</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Summary"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch08lvl1sec74"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this appendix, we learned a bit about the community behind NGINX. We saw who the major players are and what resources are available online. We also got an in-depth look at writing a bug report that should be helpful in finding a solution to a problem.</p></div></body></html>
