- en: NGINX is a high-performance web server designed to use very few system resources.
    There are many how-to's and example configurations floating around on the Web.
    This guide will serve to clarify the murky waters of NGINX configuration. In doing
    so you will learn how to tune NGINX for various situations, what some of the more
    obscure configuration options do, and how to design a decent configuration to
    match your needs.

- en: You will no longer feel the need to copy-paste a configuration snippet because
    you will understand how to construct a configuration file to do exactly what you
    want it to do. This is a process, and there will be bumps along the way, but with
    the tips explained in this book you will feel comfortable writing an NGINX configuration
    file by hand. In case something doesn't work as expected, you will be able to
    debug the problem yourself or at least be capable of asking for help without feeling
    like you haven't given it a try yourself.

- en: This book is written in a modular fashion. It is laid out to help you get to
    the information you need as quickly as possible. Each chapter is pretty much a
    standalone piece. Feel free to jump in anywhere you feel you need to get more
    in-depth about a particular topic. If you feel you have missed something major,
    go back and read the earlier chapters. They are constructed in a way to help you
    grow your configuration piece-by-piece.
