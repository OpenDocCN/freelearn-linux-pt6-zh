- en: Nginx is an open source high-performance web server, which has gained quite
    some popularity recently. Due to its modular architecture and small footprint,
    it has been the default choice for a lot of smaller Web 2.0 companies to be used
    as a load-balancing proxy server. It supports most of the existing backend web
    protocols such as FCGI, WSGI, and SCGI. This book is for you if you want to have
    in-depth knowledge of the Nginx server.
