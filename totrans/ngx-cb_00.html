<p class="mce-root">In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning. Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "To install the latest NGINX release, add the NGINX mainline repository by adding the following to <kbd>/etc/yum.repos.d/nginx.repo</kbd>."</p>
<p class="mce-root">A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="mce-root">server {<br/>      listen 80;<br/>      server_name server.yourdomain.com; <br/>      access_log /var/log/nginx/log/host.access.log combined;<br/>         <br/>      location / {<br/>          root /var/www/html;<br/>          index index.html; <br/>      }<br/>}</pre>
<p class="mce-root">Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>mkdir -p /var/www/vhosts</strong> </pre>
<p class="mce-root"><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "As our configuration is very simple, we can simply accept the default settings and hit <span class="packt_screen">Create</span>."</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
