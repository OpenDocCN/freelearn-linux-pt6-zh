- en: NGINX is not only supported by a vibrant community, but also has a company to
    back it now, too. Igor Sysoev, the original author of NGINX, co-founded NGINX,
    Inc. in 2011 to offer professional support to companies using NGINX. He and the
    other NGINX developers are still available to the community, though. This appendix
    provides a brief overview of community resources available online.

- en: The mailing list at `nginx@nginx.org` has been active since 2005\. Subscribing
    to the list and seeing what kind of questions are asked and how they are answered
    is the best way to get an idea of how to get help from the list. Before asking
    a question, search online for an answer first. There is also an FAQ at [http://wiki.nginx.org/Faq](http://wiki.nginx.org/Faq).
    See if someone has already asked the question recently by searching the archives
    at [http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx/](http://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx/).
    It's not only embarrassing for you if the same question has been asked recently,
    but it's also annoying to the readers of the list.

- en: The IRC channel `#nginx` at `irc.freenode.net` is a real-time resource for those
    interested in getting to know the developers and having helpful responses to short
    queries. Please do follow IRC etiquette though when visiting the channel. Larger
    blocks of text such as configuration files or compilation output should go into
    a Pastebin and only the URL copied into the channel. More details about the channel
    can be found at [http://wiki.nginx.org/IRC](http://wiki.nginx.org/IRC).

    resource for a number of years. Here you will find a complete directive reference,
    a module listing, and a number of configuration examples. Keep in mind though,
    that this is a wiki, and the information found on it is not guaranteed to be accurate,
    up-to-date, or to fit your needs exactly. As we have seen throughout this book,
    it is always important to think about what you want to accomplish before setting
    out to derive the solution.

    There are some documents introducing NGINX, as well as How-to's and pages describing
    each module and directive.

- en: When searching for help online, it is useful to be able to write a good bug
    report. You will find that an answer is much more easily forthcoming if you can
    formulate the problem in a clear, reproducible way. This section will help you
    do just that.

    It will help you to first think about what it is you are trying to accomplish.

    in the report. If a file is found in the software archive, then a reference to
    that file is enough.

    has been left out. Sometimes, you will find that you have even solved the problem
    yourself, just by defining it clearly!

    who the major players are and what resources are available online. We also got
    an in-depth look at writing a bug report that should be helpful in finding a solution
    to a problem.
