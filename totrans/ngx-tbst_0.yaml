    not loading. You will learn how to find those problems using logs and your usual
    Linux toolbox. You will also learn how to minimize the probability of problems

- en: Nginx started as a web accelerator reverse proxy inside one of the big Russian
    web companies of the early 2000s. The main web server software was Apache 1.3,
    and it started to show architectural problems serving thousands of relatively
    slow clients using the old process-based model. Smart web engineers were already
    building two-tier systems of light frontends based on the `mod_proxy` Apache module
    or even used the squid caching proxy in the reverse proxy mode.

- en: The early predecessor of Nginx was named `mod_accel`, and it was also implemented
    as an Apache module. The `mod_accel` module gained some popularity among the administrators
    of some of the busiest websites, but it is nothing compared with what Nginx later
    enjoyed. Both of them are built on the idea that the additional level of proxying
    on the server side of a busy website is a good thing, providing both the extra
    flexibility and separating the job of serving slow clients from the actual response
    generation.

- en: Nginx took the idea of `mod_proxy` module to the extreme by being a self-sufficient
    separate HTTP server with a goal to solve the so-called C10K problem, that is,
    serving 10,000 concurrent connections. The numbers do not look impressive at all
    in 2016, but they did in 2007 when Nginx first claimed a significant share of
    1% of the Web according to Netcraft.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since that time, the share grew manifold while Nginx steadily gained new functionality
    and remained the ideal open source success story project with a single, talented
    developer devoting his genius to producing free quality software, which the whole
    Web could benefit from.

- en: In 2011, a commercial enterprise named Nginx, Inc. was founded, which allowed
    even more freedom for the developers (now a team). The firm provides both support
    services and a special subscription-based extended version of the software named
    Nginx Plus. We will mention some of the Nginx Plus features in the sixth chapter.

- en: In 2016, Nginx is a great tool many businesses are built upon. However, it is
    still just a tool which requires a master to show its full potential. If you want
    to understand what is going on in your web server, to be able to write correct
    Nginx configuration files and read Nginx logs, and if you want your web server
    to be very fast, you will have to become that master.

    *Troubleshooting Rare Specific Problems,* is devoted to studies of several real
    cases that you may face, from some of the simplest and easiest cases to fix to
    more problematic cases. The cases described might not be the most frequent, but
    they still provide valuable insight on the internals of the software and the methods
    of troubleshooting.'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although modern versions of Nginx support Windows, this configuration is not
    considered production-ready. Most of the examples in this book will work on your
    Windows machines, but we still recommend having a Linux or FreeBSD server for
    experiments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Nginx itself is pretty stable, so any version released since 2013 will suffice.
    Some of the newer features are only available in more recent versions, and those
    cases are marked in the book. We always recommend running modern Nginx from the
    stable line in production. As of the start of the year 2016, it is 1.8.1.
