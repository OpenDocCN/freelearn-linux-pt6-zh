We look at the existing modules available and how to compile and install them, along with practical examples of how to configure them with focus on optimizing the configuration. It also goes beyond what is available off the shelf and teaches you how to write your own module, in case something is not available from the big Nginx open source community.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
